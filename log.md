# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: July 09, 2021

**Today's Progress**: I solved almost all exercises for the first week of CS50. I learned about loops, conditionals, how to create simple functions, handle numeric data, all using the C language.

**Thoughts:** Starting something from scratch and exposing myself is a big step out of my comfort zone.

**Link to work:** TO DO

### Day 1: July 10, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Today I implement a program to calculate if a credit card number is valid using C and IBM's Hans Peter Luhn algorithm. It didn't finish, I just managed to do the initial part of saying which the brand of the card, the next step is to find out if it is valid or not.

**Thoughts:** I haven't decided yet how and if I'm going to put the codes made from CS50 activities here on github, I'm focusing on solving the activities and learning how to use C, but I'm still going to resolve this to-do in order to link the codes.
